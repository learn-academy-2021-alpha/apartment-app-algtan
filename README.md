# Process

## Challenge 1 - Planning

    Draw out a proposed database schema

    What tables do you anticipate you will need?

    What associations do your tables have?

    Explore some of the free Bootstrap themes available, which one do you want to use?

    Wireframe the main pages in the application.

    What forms will you need?

    What fields are on those forms?

    Do your forms match your database schema?

    What are the user flows?

    Protected vs. unprotected pages?

    What is the most important user flow of the application?

    Is this flow easy and intuitive for the user?

## Challenge 2 - Authentication
    
    Implement your authentication code, with stubbed out main pages

## Challenge 3 - Main UI

    Implement your main UI pages in your single page application

    Use data mocks to work with real data, but without the complexity of API integration

## Challenge 4 - API

    Finish off your application by hooking up the Database via API endpoints

    Is everything secure?
